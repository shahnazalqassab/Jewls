## GETTING STARTED WITH LEVEL1:

•	I’ll have level1.html as the main homepage, linked to script1.js & style1.css
•	We’ll start by defining the game board. It’ll be a hidden grid. The background will be a jewelry artisan workspace.
•	There will be a needle image as a head of the thread to collect the beads.
•	The beads will appear randomly on the main game board.
•	The needle will move forward every certain time period & take movements by keyboard (to it’s left & right depending on its direction)\
•	The collected needle will be attached to the thread.
•	Once the required number of beads is collected for the level the user should intersect the needle with the end of the thread
•	The user should collect 10 beads to finish.

## LEVEL 2
•	I’ll have level2.html, linked to script2.js & style2.css
•	The same functionality from level1. 
•	The number of beads needed will be more in this level by 5 bead.
•	The speed of the needle will increase.

## THE (BONUS LEVEL) << THIS WILL BE ONCE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT.
•	I’ll have level3.html, linked to script3.js & style3.css
•	Same functionality.
•	Different type of beads will appear, some will take different space of the thread.
•	Beads needed will increase by 5 more.

## FUNCTIONALITY NEEDED:
•	A function to randomly show the beads on the game board once starts. Changing the content of a location randomly. Math.random() 
•	I might check the possibility of changing the location if it wasn’t collected after certain time.
•	To stop appearing once the number collected.
•	A function to run the needle with time (A timing method).
•	A function to collect the bead.
•	A function to increase the necklace by the added bead.
•	Winning situation: intersecting with the end once the number of beads required collected.
•	Failed situations: 
•	the needle going back on itself, losing the beads.
•	The needle intersect with the thread before collecting all the beads.

## GRAPHICAL REQUIREMENTS:
•	The needle & thread.
•	The jewels.
•	The artisan workspace
