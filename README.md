#### let's make a necklace
***

## Description
> Based on the classical snake game we all enjoyed in our phones in the 90's of the past century. This one will be the same but we'll be collecting beads to make a necklace.
***

## How to Get Started:
> * Once the game start, collect the beads appearing for you.
> * In each level, the number of beads that you'll need to collect will increase.
> * Make sure you don't intersect with the necklace until you finish collecting the required amount of beads.
> * Each bead worths differently, therefore the score will be based on that.
